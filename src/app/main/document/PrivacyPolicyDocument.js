			<h3>SECURITY</h3>
				
			<p>1.	We recognize our legal obligations to protect the personal information we have gathered about individuals. We have therefore made arrangements to secure 		against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction of personal information. These arrangements may 		include physical security measures, network security measures, and organizational measures such as non-disclosure agreements and need-to-know access.</p>

			<p><b>NOTIFICATION OF LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DISCLOSURE</b></p>
			<p>1.	Where an incident occurs involving the loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information under our control, where a reasonable person 		would consider that there exists a real risk of significant harm to an individual as a result of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure, we will, 		without unreasonable delay, provide notice to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or any other relevant Federal or State body of the United States of the 		incident, including any information required by law at the time to be provided to the Commissioner. While United States law provides that the Commissioner has 		the authority to require us to notify individuals of the unauthorized access or disclosure, we may elect to immediately do so in the event we consider it 		reasonable in the circumstances. We may also be required to notify the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or any other relevant Federal or State body of the United 	States under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)</p>

			<h3>REQUESTS FOR ACCESS</h3>

				<ul>4.	We will make a reasonable effort to assist applicants and to respond as accurately and completely as reasonably possible;</ul>

				<ul>6.	Where appropriate to do so, we may require advance payment of a deposit or the entire costs of responding to a request for access to personal 				information.</ul>

			<p>2.	Please note that an individual’s ability to access his or her personal information under our control is not an absolute right.  United States law provides that 	Jobsage must not disclose personal information where:</p>

				<ul>2.	the disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual; or</ul>
				<ul>3.	the disclosure would reveal the identity of an individual who has in confidence provided us with an opinion about another individual and the individual 		providing the opinion does not consent to the disclosure of his or her identity.</ul>

			<ul>1.	the personal information is protected by any legal privilege;</ul>
			<ul>2.	the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information and it is not unreasonable to withhold that information;</ul>

			<h3>RESPONSES TO REQUESTS</h3>
			<p>1.	Our responses to requests for access to personal information will be in writing, and will confirm:</p>
				<ul>1.	whether we are providing all or part of the requested information;</ul>
				<ul>2.	whether or not we are allowing access or providing copies; and</ul>
				<ul>3.	if access is being provided, when and how that will be given.</ul>
			<p>2.	If access to information or copies are refused by us, we will provide written reasons for such refusal and the section of FOIA (the Freedom of Information Act) 	on which that refusal is based.  We will also provide the name of an individual at Jobsage who can answer questions about the refusal, and particulars of how 		the requesting individual can ask the Information and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or any other relevant Federal or State body of the United States to review 	our decision. In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must provide us with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and 		to respond to them.</p>

			<h3>REQUEST FOR CORRECTION</h3>

			<p>1.	Certain laws permit individuals to submit written requests to us to correct errors or omissions in their personal information that is in our custody or 		control. If an individual alleges errors or omissions in the personal information in our custody or control, we will either:</p>

				<ul>1.	correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, and if not contrary to law, send correction notifications to any other organizations to 			whom we disclosed the incorrect information; or</ul>
				<ul>2.	decide not to correct the personal information but annotate the personal information that a correction was requested but not made.</ul>
			<p>2.	Corrections or amendments will rarely, if ever, be made to opinions, including expert or professional opinions, as opposed to factual information, which may be 	corrected if in error.</p>


			<h3>AMENDMENT</h3>

			<p>1.	Jobsage may amend this Policy from time to time as required and without notice, in order to better meet our obligations under the law.</p>

			<h3>DISPUTES</h3>

			<p>1.	Governing Law and No Class Proceedings. The laws of the State of South Carolina, and the laws of United States applicable in South Carolina, will govern use of 	this Agreement and the interpretation, validity and effect of this Agreement, notwithstanding the parties’ physical location (whether permanent or temporary), 		residence or domicile. The parties agree to not commence any action by way of class proceedings, class action or any other claim involving court proceedings.</p>
				<ul>1.	Arbitration: The Parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not resolved by 		their mutual agreement shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before Arbitrator of the federal state or its successor, pursuant to the 			Federal Arbitration Act of United States (FAA). Either Party may commence the arbitration process called for in this Agreement by filing a written 			demand for arbitration with ADR Chambers of United States, with a copy to the other Party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the 			provisions of ADR Chambers’ Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration. The Parties will cooperate with 				ADR Chambers and with one another in selecting a single arbitrator from ADR Chambers’ panel of members, and in scheduling the arbitration proceedings. 			The Parties agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith. The provisions of this Section may be enforced by any Court of competent 		jurisdiction, and the Party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to be paid by 		the party against whom enforcement is ordered. The place of arbitration shall be Toronto, Ontario.</ul>
				<ul>1.	The arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act of United States (FAA). The arbitrator shall have the 			power to proceed with the arbitration and to deliver their award notwithstanding the default by any party in respect of any procedural order made by 			the arbitrator. It is further agreed that such arbitration shall be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action at law. The decision 			arrived at by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and no appeal shall lie therefrom. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be 			entered in any court having jurisdiction.</ul>
				<ul>2.	Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited 			discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. 		This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, 			statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this 		Agreement.</ul>
